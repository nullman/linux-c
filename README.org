* GCC Programs for Linux

  See the "Build and Run" sections of [[file:linux-c.org][linux-c.org]] to see how to build, clean,
  and run these applications. In general you follow these steps:

  Build with =make=.

  Clean with =make clean=.

  Run with =./NAME=.

  All files are generated from [[file:linux-c.org][linux-c.org]] using Emacs' org-mode literate
  programming system to "tangle" them.
